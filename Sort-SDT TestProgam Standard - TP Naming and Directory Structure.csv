Sort/SDT TestProgam Standard - TP Naming and Directory Structure,,,,
,,,,
Purpose,"Standard Naming and paths enable automated test program and pattern transfer between FSM and ATM sites. This Standard covers TP Naming, TP folder Naming and TP Directory Naming.",,,
Special,USE this page FOR SDX/HOP/CMT Program Names for PROD NAMES ONLY - See the SDXProgramRename for ENG Program Names,,,
,Use ALL CAPS for all the characters of TP name,,,
Notes,The Test Program Naming convention standard must be followed for all HVM Test Program releases including A-0 1st Si Readiness Test Programs i.e. AirSort TP and WTL,,,
,Test Program names are created using the Cake Tool only see https://wiki.ith.intel.com/x/9cMRYw,,,
,"Changes to the below naming convention requires stakeholder notification, including the SMART dB[LYA FIFA] owner. SMART dB automation is in place to filter out non-standard Test Program Name from high volume diagnosis.",,,
,ALL test program names must rename sequential when sorted. Meaning when you choose field values choose them with this requirement in mind.,,,
Release Scenario's,My Product is ready to release a program,,,
,,,,
,"Environment File has set TP_NAME = ""SRFSDJXB0H22H002303""; this was setup by the base team when we start work on this Program/Release",,,
,I am releasing a program for 22H,,,
,This is the first time I am Releasing this Program,,,
,Build the program to the <product>\tptorrent\<CurrentProgram> folder,,,
,"Rename the Program using Cake Rename script selecting the <MileStone>,<Sequential Release Number>,<YearWW>",,,
,My final Program name will be SRFSDJXB0H22H<current MileStone>0<CurrentYearWW>,,,
,,,,
,I have been releasing programs and used up all of the available A-Z fields in Character 12,,,

,Increment Character 11 by 1,,,

Product Family,"[0,1,2] #3","Need to ensure that the POP name is unique to each die type within a product family. This standard has changed (Q12024) as described in the WIKI Page for creating new product folders in Sort. Previously we matched the Atlas Product name but, as we move to a Many Sort Products to 1 Class Product (Atlas Name) we needed to change the folders/TP structure to represent <atlasName>_<UniquePopNameForSort>_<SDS|SDT|HOP|ETC> and the 3 characters here should match the UniquePopName for Sort (Field 2)",,"SKL for Skylake, ICP for Icelake PCH"

,,,,
,,"Sort: For test programs that support multiple revisions of a stepping, the lowest revision should be used. This enables NPI's with additional revisions for Fab process/recipe changes that do not require a change to the program to be released without a new Test Program.

,,"If you are supporting multiple die such as left or right die or different product programs under a single product family, such as Clear Water Forrest (CWF) supporting a Clear Water Top (CWT) and Clear Water Base (CWB) or Sapphire Rapids supporting Left and Right Die EACH product should have a different 0-9 for Character 10.",,"CWF has 2 Die/Programs,"

TP [short name/nick name] Naming Convention:,,,,
,,,,
TP Nick Name:,,,,
,,,,
·         Thought process – work within the framework of current TP Naming standard,,,,
,,,,
o    Example: 31J00,,,,
,,,,
"§  Use bit 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 as defined in the table above to construct TP nick name.  In the example, bit 10, 11, 12 = 31J; bit 13, 14 = 00",,,,
,,,,
"o    For revision/patch TP, use bit 10, 11, 12 and append ‘r’ + patch/revision #",,,,
,,,,
Example: Patch or revision 1 of 31J will be 31Jr1,,,,
,,,,
TP Naming guideline:,,,,
,,,,
·         Bit 10 is a TP rail number or swim lane.  Valid characters are 1-9,,,,
,,,,
o    Each silicon flavor in a product family gets assigned to a rail,,,,
,,,,
§  Example: (Kabylake),,,,
,,,,
§  ULT/ULX 2+2 is rail ‘1’,,,,
,,,,
§  4+2 is rail ‘3’,,,,
,,,,
§  2+3 is rail ‘2’,,,,
,,,,
§  DT 2+2 is rail ‘4’,,,,
,,,,
·         Bit 11 is silicon revision or TP sequence.  Gets uprev’ed for every major silicon change (litmus test – when TP for new silicon is not backward compatible to previous silicon).  Valid characters are 0-9,,,,
,,,,
"Bit 12 is TP series revision – do not use ‘i’, ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘q’",,,,
"For pre si TP names use (A0 stepping) X0A, X0B, X0C, (B0 stepping) X1A, X1B, X1C...",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Detailed Work Flow for Defining a Program Name,,,,
,,,,
Abbreviations: FSM: Fab Sort Manufacturing (aka Wafer Sort); ATM: Assembly Test Manufacturing (aka Die Sort);  Factory: ATM + FSM; TP: Test Program; <POP>: POP Product,,,,
#,Steps,Key Points,Reasons Why,
1,Get POP Names for your Product,POP name is a 3 letter unique identifier for each product NPI.,"Infrastructure, test program and datasets must be unique",
,,,,
,,See Here for more info,,
2,Define TP Revision for this Product/Subproducts,,All Revisions should be sequential and are set from day 1 for all programs released until the end of life for that program/subprogram,
3,Gather TP Name Inputs and create TP name based on description below this table,"Ask Sort/SDT Product Owner for Product Family/Segment, Program Type, Stepping, Tester Platform, Revision, and Release Number",Need these details to follow the convention,
4,Determine MDO and Factory sites,Ask the product’s CE or VM for the names of the MDO and Factory sites where your product will run.,Need disk space at all product has a CE and VM assigned,
,,,,
,,Ask the CE for the names of the FSM Factory PE contacts,FSM PE’s allocate disk at their sites,
,,,,
,,"Plan for sort, class, local labs and mega lab",Get complete set,
,,,,
,,Time: 1 day;  Result: Have all sites and contacts needed,,
5,Request Disk Setup in the Factory,See - https://wiki.ith.intel.com/x/kiR92,Get development disks allocated and configured,
6,Publish Directory,Email to TP Team to let them know that the disk is ready for use.,Team knows disks are ready for use,
7,Request User Permissions,See - https://wiki.ith.intel.com/x/yCR92,,
8,Create TP Name,"Create TP_NAME in the Environment file like TP_NAME = ""SRFSDJXB0H22H002303""; this is used by the naming infrastructure as the SEED for the naming see Cake SDXPROGRAMRENAME Wiki Page",Ensure the TP naming convention is followed.,
,,,,
,,Setup TRC checks (Trace or other relevant tools or scripts in use) to validate the naming is followed,,
,,,,
,,"The first 3 characters in TP name, Product Folder name and TP dir name all match",,
9,Create TP Name in TPDB based on the fields described below,Ensure naming follows TP naming convention below,Ensure the TP naming convention is followed. TPDB documentation is required for every TP release.,
10,Create Test Program Directory based on examples below underneath the Test Program Folder,TP Directory name common for each package type and build but unique for the other fields,Ensure unique TP Directory name per POP per stepping,
